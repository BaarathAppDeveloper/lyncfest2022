        "Description": "Mineral locations become more difficult to locate in geo-locations. Despite the existence of traditional means, the process of seeking is still not faster.Finding economically viable mineral reserves has become increasingly difficult. The iterative process of collecting various datasets, followed by geological interpretation, might take a long period during exploration. Massive volumes of data are gathered and analyzed, frequently with no notable mineral discoveries. As a result, explorers are looking for novel tactics and processes that will increase finding rates and shorten the exploration life cycle. Using traditional approaches, possible mineral resources are now identified by overlaying numerous layers of geoscientific data in GIS software. However, with AI and machine learning (ML) breakthroughs, complex data analysis with optimal resource use may be possible. The present statement's problems include leveraging the country's accessible geological datasets and delivering AI\/ML solutions for mineral exploration through the construction of metallogenic models. For better mineral exploration, participants can create AI-based mining exploration models by combining geological, geographical, and geophysical data. The Geological Survey of India's BHUKOSH portal contains a variety of geological datasets. These metallogenic models will aid in the identification of probable exploration hotspots. To develop an AI-based solution based on machine learning and datasets for identifying new mineral prospective locations to speed up the process.",

        "Description": "India lies sandwiched between two of the world’s “three key production areas” for opium, leading to an illicit drugs crisis. But cross-border trafficking holds only part of the explanation for the illicit drugs trade that runs through India. India’s pharmaceutical industry is “the largest provider of generic drugs globally”, as per the department of pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers. But there have been reports of clandestine manufacturing and siphoning of synthetic drugs, as well as illicit trade in chemical precursors. Currently there is no digital way of reporting drug trafficking. The only way is to reach out Narcotics squad or nearby police station. However, this is not feasible since majority of public will not be ready to disclose their profile or will not be ready to spend their time physically. The intended solution should enable public to report the findings of drug trafficking in their locality anonymously. If the system is anonymous there could be possibility of large number of false alarms, and some can be intentional too. Hence the solution should enable filtering out the false alarms by employing any kind of machine learning models. The solution should enable the public to upload any relevant information about the finding and it should be easy for the user to use with different language. supports.",
