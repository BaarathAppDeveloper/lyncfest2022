For a project, you can analyze the data packets that are sent across the network. After analyzing these packets you can work on a report to give your insights, and if required, countermeasures if there is an anomaly.

For a project, you can analyze the data packets that are sent across the network. After analyzing these packets you can work on a report to give your insights, and if required, countermeasures if there is an anomaly.

        "Problem Statement": "Email Spoofing Detection",
        "Description": "Spoofed email with swapped email id(and IP too) can come to any user’s inbox. Suggest a mechanism to filter the spoofed email at server only. - - \"Email spoofing is a form of cyber attack in which a hacker sends an email that has been manipulated to seem as if it originated from a trusted source. This kind of identity deception is widely used in phishing and spam attacks to help boost the open rate and efficacy of malicious emails. In many email attacks, embedded links lead to phishing sites designed to swipe sensitive information or login credentials from recipients. Others contain malware-laden attachments, or employ social engineering to bamboozle well-researched targets out of money in spear-phishing or business email compromise (BEC) scams. In order to spoof an email, all a fraudster needs to do is set up or compromise an SMTP server. From there, they can manipulate the ‘From’, ‘Reply-To’, and ‘Return-Path’ email addresses to make their phishing emails appear to be legitimate messages from the individual or brand they’re impersonating. This identity deception is made possible by the fact that SMTP—the Simple Message Transfer Protocol used by email systems to send, receive, or relay outgoing emails—lacks a mechanism for authenticating email addresses. It’s also exacerbated when exploited through popular cloud-based email platforms such as Gmail and Office 365. Because of their ubiquity and the precipitous volume of emails distributed by these and other email platforms, phishing attacks launched from cloud email accounts are far less likely to be detected and blocked than those sent from a lookalike domain. Hence, the objective is to find a solution and suggest a mechanism that can filter the spoofed email at server only.\"",
