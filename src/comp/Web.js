It should capture basic details of employees like Photograph (headshot), Name, Designation, Employee Number, Gender, Office Address, etc. 2. It should recognize the employee by face while capturing the attendance (entry) through face recognition and enter the relevant details including entry time in the system after successful face recognition. Similarly, while exiting the office premises, employee will be recognized using his\/her face and exit time will be entered in the system. 3. The app should automatically capture the GPS location where the attendance is being taken and allow capturing the attendance only in a geo-fenced area (100 meters within LATITUDE\/LONGITUDE) the office premises. Otherwise, the app should automatically exit. 4. The app should successfully work for any specific employees with or without wearing spectacles, cap or industrial helmet. The mobile app needs be developed on Android platform. The team members can be taken as employees and college\/hackathon premises will be taken as office address for the purpose of demonstration. The mobile app must use deep learning powered computer vision for face recognition and the accuracy must be above 95%. Further, during the actual hackathon, a randomly chosen person will be entered as a new employee in the app and it should successfully capture the attendance (entry and exit) of that new employee for the purpose of demonstration of successful working of the app in order for GAIL to accept the solution.
